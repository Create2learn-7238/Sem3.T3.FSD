            FSD most commonly refers to Tesla's Full Self-Driving capability, a
            supervised driver-assist system that handles steering, acceleration,
            and braking. It can navigate city streets, highways, and roundabouts
            but requires constant driver supervision to intervene when needed.
            Another meaning of FSD is a Flame Supervision Device, which cuts off
            gas to an appliance if the flame goes out.

            Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known
            for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van
            Rossum and first released in 1991. Here are 12 lines providing key
            information about Python: Interpreted: Python is an interpreted
            language, meaning code is executed line by line, which helps in
            quick error detection. Easy to Learn: It has a straightforward,
            English-like syntax that is easy for beginners to learn.
            Readability: Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability
            through the use of significant indentation.

            Probability is the measure of the likelihood of an event occurring,
            dealing with chance and randomness. It is expressed as a number
            between 0 and 1, where 0 means the event is impossible and 1 means
            it is certain. Statistics is the branch of mathematics dealing with
            the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and
            organization of data. The basic formula for probability is the
            number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible
            outcomes.
